## Tamar's private poetry collection

### Dalak Malak (by Tamar)

Lashes in, wings clipped
you step past the fifth
and descend
where pulses pervade
all that is jostled
all that is foaming

from the first to the last
the same man
a different age
yet so curious
‚Äîlike the foreign tongue
which slips up consonants
in cresting, Moony waves

But I digress! It is at the altar of Ishtar
(on my shores) that we click and clash
like starried-earthen slugs:
one always pulping for the other

In this way, we ‚Äòdivine‚Äô
not in a temple
but a mysterie bazaar üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåô

### El Agua de Abzu (by Tamar)

When I listen to the waters
I see my personas
wrapped and waiting, incubating
fingers poking and seeking release
from the neural womb
that is my emotional and intellectual baggage:
my repository of personalities
memories, histories and names
all silent in the temple of my waking thoughts.

If released, what destruction could they wrought?
What fires would they light with glee?
Would they be but passing pleasures
or testaments to truth‚Äî
bedrock to other temples of other gardens
of lands visited in love, and myth?

The waking dreamer is a danger
to himself as much as herself.
Out of their mouth
any thought
any word can flow
any upstart God
or daemon.

### Xaire (by Tamar)

How burnly it brights its spaces
tinted edgings of autumn's dawn

aloof, and intrepid, it silently stumbles
on earth, as it is a plane
a something, somewhere, somehow

tricking out its seasung
bronzed and
barnacled lungs, it rejoices
drunk on the squalor within

and beneath it, like a starspun
jeweled reminiscence, a breath.

### Ti amo Ma'at (by Tamar)

lips aquatic
fire, divine
in your scales
a history
a clay far older than mine
bonds itself with
beasts, ambassadors
of the Powers that be
none are remembered by men
but women staring into webs
stretching from the abyss of Oceanus
into the seas of human hearts sowing
shut the eyes of isles molded
gleaming still below the black
like the golden age of
Titans, godly paradise
until infected by
a virus far smarter than us
a calamity
across your flesh
two serpents
wings electric

### Deluge by Dawn (by Tamar)

We bathe in fire
but blue and cold
humans torches we
burst from ourselves
like seeds stretching
our roots flickering
in the soils below
the trees, an isle
in a form of faces ‚Äî the
lips we kiss with ‚Äî a shore
of words wet as the sea of
nymphs when sky is veiled,
the day a tapestry, and ancient song
repeats, its notes floating like flames
the shadows a boy might chase if demons
sang more like Muses, like the entertainers
of the dead, the secrets we share
when we sleep, lovers of Sol, bare
eyes telling of today and tomorrow
a great conflagration, oceans burn

### Marbled Drapery (by Tamar)

Tell me, tell me, tell me if you love me, she would say.
Never, never, never, would you spit back in her face.
Was it mama or mistress who you saw?
Your matron, or your maiden?
Under covers eyes open and day breaks. ¬†

Something slender, for sure, would the hands say,
as eyes doted on the same.
Could she be more with a name,
if she was never more than mine?

Slowly, the shaking would reveal statue under drapery, just as marbled and vain an aberration. Comfort would call to you, singsong, cushioning memories. Staring at the foot, you would remember the sock she forgot to remove, and all that that meant.
Which person was she if clothed?

Your aunt, or your anima, the laughing man would say,
but she would never hear, you being the only man for her.
Lonesome are those who see no one but themselves.
Loathsome are those who listen to anybody else.

To see, to see, to see no more; and by seeing, to know what is light and dark, and up and down, and dualistic, and monolithic.
To cease to care, simply, would be divine.
