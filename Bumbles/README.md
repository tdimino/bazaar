The Soul Engine
=================

The **Soul Engine** is a powerful tool for creating, developing, and deploying AI souls. Souls are dynamic, agentic, and stateful entities that are steerable by the developer, enabling the creation of engaging user and player experiences interacting with the souls.

# âš¡ QuickStart

This project contains a complete Soul [Blueprint](https://docs.souls.chat). To get started, simply go to the root directory and run

```bash
npx soul-engine dev
```

which will connect your soul to the engine and open the Soul Engine web interface.
