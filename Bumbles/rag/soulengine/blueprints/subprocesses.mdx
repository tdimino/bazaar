# Subprocesses

`MentalProcesses` can be launched to run continuously in the background following each run of the main-thread `MentalProcess` by specifying them in the `subprocesses` parameter of the soul's Blueprint. The behavior of `subprocesses` is the following:
- They operate on the `WorkingMemory`, identical to the main-threaded process
- Each subprocess runs in order of the `subprocesses` list
- Any new incoming `Perception` terminates execution of the `subprocesses`

As an example, consider a mental process that continuously learns about the user the soul is speaking with:

```typescript filename="subprocesses/learnsAboutTheUser.ts"
import { html } from "common-tags";
import { ChatMessageRoleEnum, CortexStep, internalMonologue, mentalQuery } from "socialagi";
import { MentalProcess, useActions, useProcessMemory } from "soul-engine";

// Write a custom cognitive function for SocialAGI that will keep notes about a user
const userNotes = () => () => ({
  command: ({ entityName: name }: CortexStep) => {
    return html`
      Model the mind of ${name}.
      
      ## Description
      Write an updated and clear set of notes on the user that ${name} would want to remember.

      ## Rules
      * Keep descriptions as bullet points
      * Keep relevant bullet points from before
      * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
      * Do not write any notes about ${name}

      Please reply with the updated notes on the user:'
  `},
  process: (_step: CortexStep<any>, response: string) => {
    return {
      value: response,
      memories: [{
        role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant,
        content: response
      }],
    }
  }
})

const learnsAboutTheUser: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep }) => {
  // track a model of the user
  const userModel = useProcessMemory("Unkown User")
  const { log } = useActions()

  let step = initialStep
  let finalStep = initialStep

  // add the existing model to memory
  step = step.withMemory([{
    role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant,
    content: html`
    ${step.entityName} remembers:

    # User model

    ${userModel.current}
  `
  }])

  // compute the new model
  step = await step.next(
    internalMonologue("What have I learned specifically about the user from the last few messages?", "noted"),
    { model: "quality" }
  )
  
  // save the model
  userModel.current = await step.compute(userNotes(), { model: "quality"})

  return finalStep
}

export default learnsAboutTheUser
```
