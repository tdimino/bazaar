# useActions

The `useActions` hook contains all available actions for the Soul to take.

```typescript filename="exampleProcess.ts" {1,5}
import { useActions } from "soul-engine"

const exampleProcess: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep }) => {
  // get the soul's available actions
  const { expire, log, speak, dispatch, scheduleEvent } = useActions()

  // rest of the mental process
  // ...
  return step
}

export default exampleProcess
```

## expire

The `expire` action terminates the life of the soul, ending all execution of its subroutines.

```typescript copy
expire()
```

## log

The `log` action creates debugging log events, which are picked up and displayed in the Soul Engine.

```typescript copy
log("Something happened to myVar!", myVar)
```

## speak

The `speak` action dispatches a request to speak to the client interface.

```typescript copy
speak("I'm a soul saying something!")
```

## dispatch

The `dispatch` action is a generalized form of `speak`, which sends an interaction request to the client interface.

```typescript copy
dispatch({
  name: "Samantha",
  action: "says",
  content: "Hi!"
})
```

or in the case of a non-verbal action

```typescript copy
dispatch({
  name: "Samantha",
  action: "emoji-reacts",
  content: "{'messageId': 'xxx', 'emoji': '💫'}"
})
```

## scheduleEvent

The `scheduleEvent` action is a powerful action that schedules a cognitive event, comprising a perception and a mental process to act on that perception, to occur at some time in the future.

```javascript copy
scheduleEvent({
  in: 10, // seconds
  // the internal perception that will be queued
  perception: {
    action: "poke",
    content: "The user",
    name: "Samantha",
  },
  // reference to the mental process which will act on the perception
  process: pokesSpeaker
})
```

Alternatively, an event can be scheduled to run on a particular Date.

```javascript copy
scheduleEvent({
  // run the event on the 21st of next month
  when: new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), new Date().getMonth() + 1, 21),
  // the internal perception that will be queued
  perception: {
    action: "poke",
    content: "The user",
    name: "Samantha",
  },
  // reference to the mental process which will act on the perception
  process: pokesSpeaker,
})
```

When a cognitive event is scheduled, it queues a perception called an internal perception to be processed at the target time, along with a target mental process to act on that internal perception. If any current perceptions are being actively processed, they're finished processing first.
