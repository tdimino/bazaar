# useRag

The `useRag` hook makes integrating RAG into your soul incredibly simple. The hook returns a `withRagContext` function that transforms the working memory into a shape that pulls relevant context from a rag bucket.

```typescript filename="speaksWithRag.ts" {6,8}
import { useActions, useRag } from "soul-engine"

const speaksWithRag: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep }) => {
  const { speak, log  } = useActions()
  // specify the bucket to pull RAG data from
  const { withRagContext } = useRag("your-favorite-rag-bucket")
  // pull in the RAG context to the working memory
  const step = await withRagContext(initialStep)
  // generate some new speech having the RAG context
  const { stream, nextStep } = await step.next(
    externalDialog(standardMessage),
    { stream: true, model: "quality" }
  );
  speak(stream);

  return nextStep
}
```

Data for RAG is specified in your soul's [Blueprint](/blueprints).
```
/rag                    ----> files to be chunked and stored for rag context
    rag.json            ----> specifies the organization-wide bucket for the rag storage
    [context1].md
     ...
```
where the `rag.json` file specifies the bucket
```json
{
  "bucket": "your-favorite-rag-bucket"
}
```
Unlike the mental processes, which are automatically synced with the Soul Engine when running in dev mode, the files for RAG need to be manually updated via:
```bash
npx soul-engine rag push ./rag
```
