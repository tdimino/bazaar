# Guiding your soul's cognition

The `MentalProcess` API gives a powerful and functional way to specify stateful behavior of a soul, triggered by an external `Perception`. Each incoming perception from the client side gets added to a queue to be processed by the current `MentalProcess`.

## Main thread process

Importantly, a soul only ever has a single (main-threaded) active `MentalProcess`, which defines the current behavior set. When a `MentalProcess` executes, it operates on the current `step` of the `WorkingMemory`, returning a new `step` of the `WorkingMemory`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
As the `WorkingMemory` grows with new memories, the oldest memories are compressed and stored to potentially be recalled
</Callout>

During operation on the `WorkingMemory`'s current step (a [SocialAGI CortexStep](https://www.socialagi.dev/CortexStep/intro) managed by the Soul Engine), a soul will often generate new memories like `internalMonologue` or `externalDialog` and take actions like `speak`.

Every mental process needs to be defined and exported as its own file:

```typescript filename="mentalProcesses/exampleProcess.ts"
import { MentalProcess } from "soul-engine"

const exampleProcess: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep, params }) => {
  let step = initialStep
  // operations on the working memory step ...

  return step
}

export default exampleProcess
```

*Parameters*:
- `step`: a instance of a `CortexStep` representing the current state of the `WorkingMemory`, containing the latest `Perception` for operation on
- `params`: static props passed into the `MentalProcess`, e.g. `{ wasProvoked: true }`
