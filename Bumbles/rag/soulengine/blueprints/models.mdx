# Models

The engine supports two different GPT-based models for steps taken with SocialAGI `CortexStep`:

- `"fast"`
- `"quality"`

Right now, these map onto particular freezes of OpenAI models, but over time will change. We're experimenting with using OSS models for `"fast"` internally.

By default, `"fast"` is chosen, but the choice can be explicit via:

```javascript
step = await step.next(..., { model: "quality" })
```

Generally we recommend using `"fast"` for many internal thought processes and `"quality"` for the generation that a user or player interacts with.
