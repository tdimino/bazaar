# Debugging a Soul

The Soul interface supports connecting the web-based debugger. Add the `debug` and `token` keys to your `new Soul(...)`.

You can find your API Key (to use as the token) by using the CLI command: `npx soul-engine apikey`

```javascript
import { Soul, said } from "soul-engine/soul"

// Create a new Soul instance with a new unique identifier
const soul = new Soul({
  organization: "opensouls",
  blueprint: "samantha-provokes",
  token: "your api key", // npx soul-engine apikey
  debug: true, // this is new
})

// Listen for responses from the soul
soul.on("says", async ({ content }) => {
  console.log("Samantha said", await content())
})

// Connect the soul to the engine
soul.connect().then(async () => {
  // Send a greeting to the soul
  soul.dispatch(said("User", "Hi!"))
})

// This will print out something like:
// CONNECTED TO SOUL. DEBUG HERE: https://souls.chat/chats/opensouls/samantha-provokes/111-dddd-156a-4927-83ce-01223c

```

Visiting the URL printed to your console will give you the debug interface where you can chat, and see the incoming and outgoing `InteractionRequest`s and `Perception`s.

  If you start a soul *without* debug turned on, you cannot turn it on later. Similarly, if a soul is started with debug mode turned on, you cannot turn it off. We recommend developing your application with debug turned on and releasing a *different* soul to production, with debug turned off.
