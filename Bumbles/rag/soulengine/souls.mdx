# Creating Souls in Your Application

This page guides you through the process of working with souls in your application using the `Soul` API. It involves two major components:

1. **Client-Side `Soul` Object**: This is your local interface for interacting with a soul. After connecting the object to the Soul Engine, you can dispatch **perceptions** and listen for **interaction requests** from the soul.
1. **Soul Engine Processing**: The soul's brain (logic, memories, mental processes, etc.) are all managed automatically by the Soul Engine, operating their own isolated server-side environment. Interaction with the Soul Engine occurs via the `Soul` API.

## Creating and Connecting a New Soul (Client-Side)
To create and connect to a new soul based off the [Soul Blueprint](/blueprints) `opensouls/samantha-provokes`:

```javascript copy
import { Soul, said } from "soul-engine/soul"

// Create a new Soul instance with a new unique identifier
const soul = new Soul({
  organization: "opensouls",
  blueprint: "samantha-provokes",
})

// Listen for responses from the soul
soul.on("says", async ({ content }) => {
  console.log("Samantha said", await content())
})

// Connect the soul to the engine
soul.connect().then(async () => {
  // Send a greeting to the soul
  soul.dispatch(said("User", "Hi!"))
})
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚧">
  The development and production environments are currently unified. The active blueprint for your soul corresponds to the one deployed using `npx soulengine dev`
</Callout>

To connect a `Soul` to the engine based on a specific unique identifier:

```javascript copy {7}
import { Soul, said } from "soul-engine/soul"

// Specify a soul instance by a unique identifier
const soul = new Soul({
  organization: "opensouls",
  blueprint: "samantha-provokes",
  id: "my-favorite-id",
})

// Set up a listener for when the soul speaks
soul.on("says", async ({ content }) => {
  console.log("Samantha said", await content())
})

// Connect the soul to the engine
soul.connect().then(async () => {
  // Interact with the soul
  soul.dispatch(said("User", "Hi!"))
})
```

While we provide the `Said` convenience method, perceptions of any kind can be sent. For example:
```js
soul.dispatch({
  name: "Samantha",
  action: "felt",
  content: "A cold touch"
})
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If the soul is disconnected, all of the memories, state, and processing are persisted on the Soul Engine. The object can simply be reconnected to resume dispatching perceptions and listening for interaction requests to that specific soul.
</Callout>

### Streaming Soul Events

On the server side, souls dispatch soul events, which yield streams in the form of `AsyncIterable<string>`.

```javascript
// Register a listener for "says" interaction requests from the soul
soul.on("says", async ({ stream }) => {
  // Stream is a function returning an AsyncIterable<string>
  for await (const message of stream()) {
    // Process each message chunk
    console.log("Samantha uttered (chunk):", message)
  }
})
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Non-streaming requests are treated similarly to streaming ones. If there's only a single chunk of text, it's delivered as a single object in the stream.
</Callout>

### Setting Environment Variables Per Soul

A soul's `Blueprint` may support optional templating via environment variables. Then, you can set environment variables for each soul to customize their behavior or state.

```javascript
// Set an environment for the soul
await soul.setEnvironment({
  EMOTIONS: "Angry and upset",
})
```
