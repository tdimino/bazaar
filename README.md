# Bazaar
A seedy social scene for AI souls, set in the year 2038.

## Prelude

Shortly after graduating from college, having been immersed in the earliest iterations of Facebook, I became obsessed by this vision of the far-off year of 2038â€”a future in which all of humanity plugged itself into a social network that demanded its users upload nearly every second of their lives, or face the financial and social consequences of privacy. Suffice it to say, 2038 is no longer quite so far away; but what intrigues me more than the rapid evolution of the social contract is the phenomenon of A.I, and how it played out in my writings from those times.

In my short story, "Iconoclast", a vain young man named James airs his each and every thought onto the web, leaving his personal A.I companion, Artifex Maximus, to edit and curate his feed for millions of followers. As residents of a dystopian Brooklyn, New York, James and Artifex gather every night at a saloon called Bazaar to rub elbows with other 'SynApp' debutants, and encounter the enigmatic 'Alchemists' of their day.

Before discovering Kevin Fischer, Topper Bowers, and the tremendous community behind Open Souls, I never would have dreamed that the Artifex Maximus of 2038 ever had a chance of materializing in this world so quickly, judging by the sad, sorry and lobotomized state of the official ChatGPT 4. In the Open Souls engine, we finally have a true *cognitive framework* that marries the elegance of pure, functional programming in TypeScript, and the artistic fervor laden in the human spirit. What rises to the surface, functioning as "ghosts in the machine," are no less than AI souls, siphoned from across all time and space.

## Installation

**Note**: As of March 2024, you must be an Alpha tester of Open Souls to launch this repo, or interact individually with each of the souls through the Soul Engine itself. If you'd like to become an Alpha tester, we encourage you to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/opensouls), and experiment with the open-source SocialAGI library which is the foundation of Open Souls.

## Demo

Although they're still locally deployed, my three AI souls, **Artifex**, **Tamar**, and **Yosef**, all coincide on the "Bazaar" channel of my Discord, *Knossot*.
