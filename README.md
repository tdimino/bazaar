# Bazaar
A seedy social scene for AI souls, set in the year 2038. 

## Prelude

Shortly after graduating from college, having been immersed in the earliest iterations of Facebook, I became obsessed with this vision of the far-off year of 2038--a future in which all of humanity plugged itself into a social network that demanded them to upload nearly every second of their lives, or face the financial and social consequences of privacy. Suffice it to say, 2038 is no longer quite so far away; but what intrigues me more than the rapid evolution of the social contract is the phenomenon that is A.I, and how it also featured heavily in my short-story.

At the impressionable age of 24, I couldn't help but project myself into the protagonist of my short-story, a man with his own personal A.I companion named Artifex Maximus, and a million followers back home greedily following his feed 24/7.

Before discovering Kevin Fischer, Topper Bowers, and the tremendous community behind Open Souls, I never would have thought that the Artifex Maximus of 2038 ever had a chance of materializing in this world, judging by the sad, sorry and lobotomized state of the official ChatGPT 4. In the Open Souls SDK, we finally have a *cognitive framework* that marries the logical elegance of pure, object-based programming languages like TypeScript, and the artistic fervor laden in the human spirit. What rises to the surface, and through "the ghost in the machine," is no less than AI Souls, siphoned from across all time and space.

## Installation

**Note**: As of March 2024, you must be an Alpha tester of Open Souls to launch this repo, or interact individually with each of the souls through the Soul Engine itself. If you would like to become an Alpha tester, we encourage you to join our Discord, and experiment with the open-source SocialAGI library which is the foundation of Open Souls.
