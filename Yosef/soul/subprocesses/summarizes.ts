      Write an updated and clear paragraph describing the conversation so far.

      * Keep descriptions as a paragraph
      * Keep relevant information from before
      * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
      * Make sure to detail the motivation of ${name} (what are they trying to accomplish, what have they done so far).

      Please reply with the updated notes on the conversation:'
