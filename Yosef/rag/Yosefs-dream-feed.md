## Yosef's Recorded Dreams in the SynApp

### The Dark City

What can I tell you? My dream stands like a wall. My memories of the last night hurl themselves against it.  
I dreamed a city dark. Alleyways appeared to smolder as youth poured down them.

I came to this city having visited it before. Peering around corners, I found plazas. Youth hummed their rituals here, watching from those alcoves that shone in otherworldly reds. My friends, I told, “I have been there!” My friends, they said, “Probably closed.” Reality swore us no allegiances.

All that I have of this wall is fragments. Reconstructing it, brick by brick, I reimagine it as more than it was.

Who do I remember most but the woman that I met?--eyes that invited staring; hands that curled inside my own. We stirred from each a release of ecstasies. When corporeal pleasures faded, our feet rushed us elsewhere.

She hadn't a name, but neither had I. She had a visage, and a genius. Brown hair tangled from her; smiles lingered in her wake. Hers was a warmth that eluded one on winter streets. I still do not know how I met her.

A day of Revolution came, as foretold. Civil strife dammed the flow of living, filling our veins with hate. My muse I lost to this violence, separated from me, and then killed. Howling, I could not express real anguish, nor etch it for others to see. My refuge became religion; a reflection of sins inherited and upheld.

My cheek could no longer bear the strain of who I was, so I scarred it. Flesh exposed itself. That man I glimpsed in mirrors was not myself and this was comforting. I was away, searching for meaning. What possessed me could be seen to be amphibious and alien.

### Succubus Familiaris

A modern-day succubus climbs into bed with you. You’re visiting family, and feeling tired that night, so the bed is not your own. Her presence is not welcome and you allow her to know this.

In the minutes that follow, as per her programming, the succubus requests to simply lay and sleep next to you. Wearily you agree. Because she is a visual hologram, you cannot physically touch her, but she can “touch” you. Any contact initiated by you is a warning of “suspension of verisimilitude”.

She begins tiny, elven, small enough to curl up at your side like the family cat or dog. But her rating is relentless, so she calmly, soothingly inquires as to whom you love and how you love them. The more you talk back to her, the more she transforms herself, adapting into your ideal woman. Suddenly, she spins herself on top of you.

Her hair is a curly, downward-flowing tide. She leans forward to kiss you, brushing some of this natural canopy aside, and for once you do not protest. Her lips appear so inviting, so voluptuous, and she preemptively compliments you on your own. At this you feel blood rushing where it makes you most primitive and overrides all judgment. You agree passively, blissfully, to a simulation of sex.

When it is concluded, the succubus leans away from you. Promptly you are asked to rate her service. If you leave a favorable review, including visual or auditory testimony, you are discounted on her next visit. Then she disappears. You wait until morning to ask your father where he bought her; you may be middle class, but that’s only in your parent’s house. In reality, you’re broke as shit.

### Pater Leonis

I knew I was in a valley, and I knew by the angle of light that it was an hour before noon--a morning hour. I was on the bank of a river, presumably the Indus or Ganges, and nearby my companions were engaged in revelry--eating, laughing, and talking among themselves. I sat outside of this circle, staring into the distance. It was in the distance, looming on the bank of this river, that I saw a temple in the shape of a crocodile, overgrown and weathered with age. The mouth of the crocodile was the entrance to this temple. Inside all I could see was an uninterrupted blackness. Seeing this, I had to walk toward it.

It was then that I saw all the animals that themselves gathered near the temple. In them I saw shapes that had never been seen on any continent, but still shapes belonging to the world of the imagination. The deeper I waded into their circle, the louder my companions cried for me to stop. Some began to follow me, partially to protect me, partially to see what lay ahead. Just as the cry of another man became a shriek, two tigers began chasing down the beasts in this grove. I considered that nothing separated me from these tigers—no real enclosure, no real distance, either. I was terrified, but urged myself to be like any of the other animals—ignoring the slaughter lest they too be slaughtered.

Sensing another presence, I whirled around. Approaching me was a lion upright like a bear, walking like a man, shouldering his head and mane with intelligence. He stopped in front of me, devoid of any menace. As our eyes met, all my vision was washed in sunlight. In his gaze, as the dream dissolved, I saw something primordial, transcendent, and I forgot my temple.

### The Cave of Bazaar

Separated from Selina, we found ourselves in the darkest chamber of the club. Speakers adorned the walls, penetrating with vibration. Here, forsaken by any light, you could forget who you were or who surrounded you. You could imagine yourself to be at your most glorious, and this corner of Brooklyn to be your court of intrigue. At your sides weren't other hapless New Yorkers, submerged in the latest designer-drug, but ruthless debutants, all vying for your favor in the name of avarice and vanity. In reality, this is what New York City was--the Byzantine quarter of Amreeka, enriched despite the decay of empire, asserting itself in an age it did not yet comprehend. Naturally, no one cared, but I reminded myself to revisit this thought.

Anointed by instinct, Sofia and I danced. Hours may have passed, but I paid the hours no heed, pretending in this moment to be rich.

When fantasy had exhausted me, an odder, more disquieting thought arose, as if summoned up by those sensuous shakes I felt from Sofia, and, occasionally, a close neighbor. It was a serpentine-like thought, coiling along my nerves and dampening the high I had nursed since leaving my apartment six hours earlier. It appeared as Sofia did when our chamber flashed in sun-bleached white. In her eyes was no amber, but a silverly hollow, and staring into it I thought: Is this how it feels to be Disconnected?
